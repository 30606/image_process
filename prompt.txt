# Image Processing Task Prompt

I need a Python script that performs automated image processing on pairs of PNG images (3000x3000 pixels). The script should handle the following operations:

## Input Images
- Two PNG images of the same object (3000x3000 pixels each):
  1. One with background
  2. One without background (transparent)
- The main object in both images is not centered

## Required Operations

### 1. Centering the Transparent Image
- Take the PNG without background
- Calculate the center point of the object
- Move the object to the exact center of the image (3000x3000)
- Preserve all object details and transparency
- Calculate and store the X and Y distances the object moved to reach center

### 2. Background Image Processing
- Create a new white canvas (3000x3000 pixels)
- Take the image with background
- Move this image onto the canvas using the same X,Y distances calculated in step 1
- This should result in the object being centered on the canvas
- Multiply the background color with the white canvas color
- This will create a slightly blurry/modified background

### 3. Final Composition
- Take the centered transparent PNG from step 1
- Overlay it precisely on the processed background from step 2
- Use the stored X,Y distances to ensure perfect alignment

## Technical Requirements
- Use Python with PIL (Python Imaging Library) or similar imaging libraries
- Make the solution modular and reusable
- Include error handling for different image sizes/formats
- Implement functions to:
  * Calculate object center in transparent PNG
  * Determine movement distances
  * Process background multiplication
  * Handle final composition
- Add comments explaining each major step
- Include logging of movement distances and operations

## Important Considerations
- The solution should work with any pair of images following the same pattern
- The script should verify input image dimensions and formats
- Include checks for transparency in the no-background image
- Add validation for successful centering
- Include progress indicators for each step

Please provide a complete, well-documented Python solution that accomplishes all these tasks while being robust and reusable for different image pairs.







Image Conversion Script Explanation:

1. **Format Selection:**
   - The user selects the output format (JPEG, WebP, or AVIF) via command-line arguments.
   - The script validates the input format and provides specific instructions based on the selected format.

2. **Image Processing Logic:**
   - The script walks through all directories within the input folder, finds all PNG files, and prepares them for conversion.
   - It processes images concurrently using a thread pool (multi-threading) for faster processing.

3. **Format-Specific Conversion:**
   - **JPEG/JPG**: Converts images to JPEG format with options like progressive rendering and optimization.
   - **WEBP**: Converts images to WebP with configurable quality and compression method.
   - **AVIF**: Converts images to AVIF format, which is a modern and high-efficiency format for image compression.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - If the conversion fails for any image, an error message is printed, and the script continues processing the remaining files.

5. **Thread Pool:**
   - The script uses Python’s `ThreadPoolExecutor` to convert multiple images concurrently based on the number of threads provided by the user.

6. **Folder Structure:**
   - The output folder structure mirrors the input folder structure, ensuring that converted images are saved in corresponding subfolders.

7. **Multi-threading and Performance:**
   - The `max_threads` value ensures the script utilizes multiple cores for concurrent processing. Be cautious not to overload the system with too many threads.
